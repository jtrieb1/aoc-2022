# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 event. It's all in Rust.

I've tried to keep this as clean and idiomatic as possible, but I'm still in the process of learning Rust. A lot of the decisions I've made in this
project have been made with the goal of practicing certain concepts, such as the macro system or dynamic dispatch. These solutions are not intended to
be the shortest or simplest possible. They are intended to be easy to read, understand, expand, and maintain. That's my goal, anyway.
