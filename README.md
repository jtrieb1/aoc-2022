# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 event. It is all in Rust.
I've included a `utils.rs` file that provides some nice clean methods for parsing the text input given.
It also includes a trait for the solutions to implement so that they can all be aggregated and run in series in main.

Rust is a neat language. I've tried to keep this as clean and idiomatic as possible, but I'm no expert.
